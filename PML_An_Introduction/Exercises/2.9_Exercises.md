**Exercise 2.1**

a. The set $ii$ is sufficient for the calculation, because:
$$
P(H|e_1,e_2)=\frac{P(H)P(e_1,e_2|H)}{P(e1,e2)}
$$
according to the Bayes rule.

b. Both $i$ and $ii$ are sufficient now, because:
$$
E_1,E_2|H\rightarrow P(e_1,e_2|H)=P(e_1|H)P(e_2|H)
$$


**Exercise 2.2**

Suppose a tetrahedron dice where three faces are painted as red, green and blue,respectively, and the 4th face is painted with all three colors.

Any pair of variables are independent, for example:
$$
\begin{align*}
P(red\cap blue) &= P(red) * P(blue)\\
&=\frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2}\\
&=\frac{1}{4}
\end{align*}
$$
But:
$$
\begin{align*}
P(red\cap green\cap blue)\neq \frac{1}{8}
\end{align*}
$$
